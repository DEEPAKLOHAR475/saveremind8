# save remind 8
i created this free blender addon that reminds us if we have not saved the newly created file it also reminds us every interval to save it plays a notification sound that we can choose ,
 we can also choose the time interval for the reminder ,to install download the .py file and install it in blender by going to edit preferances and addon , after installing it tick the checkbox next to "save reminder" then under that you can select the time interval and also the sound that you want to play, make sure the sound is in wav or mp3 and also it should be atleast 5 seconds because the starting cuts off sometimes. if you like what i do email me to thank me or donate to me at dlohar475@gmail.com
